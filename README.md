# Simple rules = Emergent behaviour
In this system, we leverage a few weights with some simple rules that create a relatively complex yet natural-looking swarm of flocking entities that follow the group cohesively.

The three rules that guide them are Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion. Check the video for an in-depth overview of the system
Plus features are position follow and ground/obstacle avoidance.

MaxSpeed and MinSpeed clamp - Clamp the speed of the entities as well as the minimum speed when flying.

Thanks for coming over! Keep coding!
